			<p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises scientific and engineering aspects of computing. 
			CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs. 
			It is offered in both Undergraduate as well Postgraduate with specializations.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an academic curriculum that combines the fields of Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
			It is one of the most popular courses among engineering students. CSE is an enthralling and unique innovative subject that encourages students to pursue creativity and technology.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>The course covers a wide range of subjects while highlighting the fundamentals of computer programming and networking. 
			Logic, algorithms, abstraction, and computability are only a few of the concepts covered in Computer Science. 
			Including software engineering, networking, distributed databases, information processing, programming languages, and various other topics.
			</p>
			</br>Despite the fact that CSE is one of the engineering specializations, candidates undertaking the curriculum can choose from a variety of other specializations such as telecommunications, 
			web design, computer hardware and software implementation and maintenance, and so on.</p>

		<button class="collapsible">Civil Engineering</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Civil engineering is the professional practice of designing and developing infrastructure projects. 
			This can be on a huge scale, such as the development of nationwide transport systems or water supply networks, or on a smaller scale, such as the development of individual roads or buildings.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>All aspects of building a structure fall under the remit of a civil engineer. 
			This can include planning, design, budgeting, surveying, construction management and analysis, and often civil engineering careers encompass a combination of all these elements.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>The great thing about civil engineering in the real world is that it’s an industry that perpetually adapts to the demands and desires of society. 
			In recent years civil engineering has adapted to consider many contemporary environmental concerns, helping to address issues of pollution and scarce water supplies, while considering the potential of sustainable energy within the industry.

		<button class="collapsible">Mechanical Engineering</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Mechanical engineering is the study, design, development, construction, and testing of mechanical and thermal sensors and devices, including tools, engines, and machines. Mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet a wide range of human needs.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>Mechanical engineering subjects include automobile engineering, manufacturing engineering, power plant engineering, thermal engineering, and mechatronics engineering, which is a combination of electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering.
			What do mechanical engineers do? Mechanical engineers generally work in offices but are sometimes called to the field, visiting worksites when a problem or piece of equipment needs their personal attention, and to oversee elements of construction.
			Mechanical engineers work mostly in engineering services, research and development, and manufacturing.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>Mechanical engineering has its roots in the industrial revolution with the advent of the steam engine, automated manufacturing, and the demands of railroad transportation requiring increasingly innovative and sophisticated engineering solutions.

		<button class="collapsible">Electrical Engineering</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering, and dates back to the late 19th century. It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>Early experiments with electricity included primitive batteries and static charges. However, the actual design, construction and manufacturing of useful devices and systems began with the implementation of Michael Faraday Law of Induction, which essentially states that the voltage in a circuit is proportional to the rate of change in the magnetic field through the circuit. This law applies to the basic principles of the electric generator, the electric motor and the transformer. The advent of the modern age is marked by the introduction of electricity to homes, businesses and industry, all of which were made possible by electrical engineers.

		<button class="collapsible">Electronics and Communication Engineering</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualize and oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analog transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analog communication, analog integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite communication, antennae, and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered by various colleges at the UG as well PG level leading to BTech (4 years) and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively.

		<button class="collapsible">Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Instrumentation is a pioneer field of engineering in the modern era. In this fast growing age of automation and process industries, instrumentation engineer is an inevitable choice of every industry.  So it is very essential and relevant in implementing a department which moulds young talents in the field of instrumentation. With that view we have started the Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering in the year of 2002. The annual intake is 60.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>The department consists of highly qualified and eminent faculty members with immense knowledge and vast experience in teaching and industry. For the last eight years, the department has made several achievements in the field of technical education. It is proud to announce our students had achieved First and Second Ranks in the M G University examinations from 2006 to 2018 as a continuum. A large number of students from our department are placed in the national and multinational companies.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>The department has well equipped laboratories such as "Transducers and Measurements Lab", "Instrumentation Lab", “Virtual Instrumentation Lab” and fully automated "Process Control Lab" which are essentially necessary for the students to excel in practical fields of instrumentation. It addition we have a dedicated Research Lab and Calibration Lab
